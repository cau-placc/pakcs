PAKCS: Release Notes
====================

Release notes for PAKCS Version 1.11.2 (September 6, 2013, under development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to version 1.11.1:
* Front-end updated (it writes and reads new kinds of interface files
  with the suffix `.curry`).
* Saved states, i.e., executables for a main program `prog`
  are now stored in the file `prog` (instead of `prog.state`
  as in previous releases).
* CASS tool (Curry Analysis Server System) added and integrated
  into currydoc.
* Interactive command ":analyze" removed and ":usedimports" added.
  The removed features to analyze a program are available via the
  Curry Browser.
* Library `Function` added.
* Library `HTML`: default (white) background for body of generated
  web pages removed (since this is usually defined in css files).
* Library `IO`: Fixed a bug in `hGetLine` which caused an end-of-file error
  when reading a non-empty line without a newline termination.
* Type inference tool (see `currytools/typeinference`) added.
  This tool can be used to annotate expressions in FlatCurry programs
  with their type.


Release notes for PAKCS Version 1.11.1 (February 13, 2013)
----------------------------------------------------------

Changes to version 1.11.0:
* The front end accepts typed expressions of the form "Expr :: TypeExpr".
  However, such type annotations are currently ignored by the compiler
  since the target language Prolog is untyped.
* Parser strategy for combinations of functional and non-linear patterns
  improved. Parser also accepts as-patterns inside functional patterns.
* Library `Directory`: Operation `copyFile` added.
* Library `FlatCurry` extended to represent typed expressions
  by a new constructor `Typed`.
* Library `SetFunctions`: Operations `choose` and `select` added.
* Bug fix in script `parsecurry`.


Release notes for PAKCS Version 1.11.0 (December 18, 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes to version 1.10.1:
* New front end version included that implements new features of Curry,
  e.g., `fcase` expressions and non-linear patterns in left-hand sides
  of program rules.
* Syntax of records slightly changed to avoid problems
  with guarded case branches (their syntax conflicted with old syntax
  for selection of record fields):
  - Field selection operator is "`:>`" (instead of "`->`" in old syntax).
  - Record construction uses the operator "`:=`" for setting field values
    similarly to record updates (instead of "`=`" in the old syntax).
* Showing characters: `print '\''` fixed
* Library `GUI`: types of various main operations (like `runInitGUI`,
  `runInitGUIwithParams`) slightly changed (for compatibility with
  KiCS2 version of the library). The old operations are still
  available as `runInitGUI'` etc.
* Library `Markdown`: title argument added to `markdownText2CompleteHTML`
* Custimzation variables in `.pakcsrc` file extended.
