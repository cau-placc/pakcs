<h1>PAKCS Resources</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

This page is intended for newcomers to PAKCS, the 
Portland Aachen Kiel Curry System.
It contains links to distribution sites, to local documentation,
to examples, and a short overview of the use of the compiler
interpreter.

<h3>Links</h3>

<h4>Downloading and installing PAKCS</h4>
<blockquote>

This section tells you where to find the distribution of PAKCS,
what to download and what is needed on the host computer.
If you are reading this file, you may have already
downloaded and installed the PAKCS distribution. 
Thus, this section may not be of interest to you.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> Where can I run PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> PAKCS runs under <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a>,
 <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/" target="_blank">Solaris</a>,
 and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a>.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> What software do I need to install to run PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> The host computer must have installed
<a href="http://www.sics.se/sicstus/" target="_blank">SICStus Prolog</a> or
<a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org" target="_blank">SWI-Prolog</a>.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> Where can I download PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> There is an 
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/">official site</a>
at the University of Kiel.
There is also a <a href="https://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/pakcs/">
mirror site</a> at Portland State.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> What should I download to run PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Look for "<b>Download PAKCS</b>" in a PAKCS website.
The distribution consists of a gzipped tar archive of about 3 - 5 Mb
(depending on your architecture).
It includes all you need to run PAKCS plus several libraries,
documentation and examples.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> Do I need a license to run PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> No. However, you may need a license for both Solaris
and SICStus Prolog.<br/><br/>

<b>Q:</b> How do I install PAKCS?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Open the downloaded archive using the Unix command
<tt><b>tar zxf ~/pakcs_....tar.gz</b></tt>. This will create a directory
called <tt><b>pakcs</b></tt>.
Follow the instructions contained in the file
<tt><b><a href="https://git.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/curry/pakcs/-/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a></b></tt> in this directory.<br/><br/>
</blockquote>

<h4>Running the first program</h4>
<blockquote>

This section tells you how to execute your first Curry program.
It assumes a successful installation of PAKCS.
PAKCS is installed by a script that also tests the correctness
of the installation.

<ul>
<li> Verify that the compiler/interpreter and other tools
are in your <i>PATH</i> environment variable.
Issue the <tt><b>which</b></tt> command to the shell prompt
as shown below:
<pre>
    [antoy@redstar test]$ which pakcs
    ~/local/pakcs/bin/pakcs
    [antoy@redstar test]$ 
</pre>
You should see a line such as <tt><b>~/local/pakcs/bin/pakcs</b></tt>.
The exact content is not important.
If you see a line containing <tt><b>no pakcs in ...</b></tt>
you must extend your <i>PATH</i> environment variable.
Many details depend on your computer system and you should
ask them to your system administrator.

<p><li> Create a file which name extension "<tt><b>curry</b></tt>"
for example <tt><b>first.curry</b></tt>.  The file contains the
following single line of code:
<pre>
    test n = take n [0,2..]
</pre>

<p><li> Start the compiler/interpreter as follows:
<pre>
    [antoy@redstar test]$ pakcs
</pre>
Several lines are output, including the PAKCS logo till you see
<pre>
    Type ":h" for help

    Prelude>
</pre>
"<tt><b>Prelude&gt;</b></tt>" is the prompt you get when no
file has been loaded yet.
As suggested, you may try typing "<tt><b>:h</b></tt>"
for a list of available commands, or you can load 
the Curry program you created.

<p><li> Load your Curry program with the command "<tt><b>:l</b></tt>"
followed by a file name, i.e. "<tt><b>first</b></tt>"
in this example.  It is not necessary to type the file extension
"<tt><b>.curry</b></tt>":
<pre>
    Prelude> :l first
</pre>
Several line of informative messages are printed.
No error or warning message should be generated for the
above program.
The prompt is changed to "<tt><b>first&gt;</b></tt>",
the name of the program you have just loaded.

<p><li> Execute some function of your program.
In this example, only one function by the name of <tt><b>test</b></tt>
has been defined. This function take an argument which should
be a non-negative integer.  When the argument is <i>n</i>,
the list of the first <i>n</i> (starting from 0) even number is
printed. E.g.:
<pre>
    first> test 8
    Result: [0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14] ?
</pre>
The program is now waiting for your input.
If you enter a semicolon followed by a carriage return,
the program attempts to find another result for your
input.  In this case, there are no other results,
thus you get the message
"<tt><b>No more solutions.</b></tt>"
and the prompt.
If you enter carriage return, you get immediately the prompt.

<p><li> At this point you can execute again some function of
your program, load another file or quit by entering the
command "<tt><b>:q</b></tt>".

</ul>
