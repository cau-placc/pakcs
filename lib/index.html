to every Curry program.

This library contains a collection of functions for
obtaining lists of solutions to constraints.

non-deterministic operations between I/O actions in
order to connects the worlds of logic and functional programming
and to avoid non-determinism failures on the I/O level.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/Assertion.html"><code>Assertion</code></a>:
This library defines the datatype and functions for the
Curry module tester "currytest".
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/Char.html"><code>Char</code></a>:
This library contains some useful functions on characters.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/CLPFD.html"><code>CLPFD</code></a>:
This library supports constraint programming with
finite domain constraints.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/CLPR.html"><code>CLPR</code></a>:

arithmetic constraints over real numbers.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/CLPB.html"><code>CLPB</code></a>:
This library provides a Boolean constraint solver based on BDDs.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/Combinatorial.html"><code>Combinatorial</code></a>:
This library contains a collection of common non-deterministic
and/or combinatorial operations.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/Constraint.html"><code>Constraint</code></a>:
This library contains
some useful operations for constraint programming.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/CSV.html"><code>CSV</code></a>:
This library supports reading/writing files in CSV
(comma separated values) format that can be imported and exported
by most spreadsheed and database applications.
</li>

<li> <a href="CDOC/Database.html"><code>Database</code></a>:
Library for accessing and storing data in databases.
The contents of a database is represented in this library
as dynamic predicates that are defined by facts than can change over
time and can be persistently stored.
All functions in this library distinguishes between <em>queries</em> that
access the database and <em>transactions</em> that manipulates data
in the database. Transactions have a monadic structure.
Both queries and transactions can be executed as I/O actions.
However, arbitrary I/O actions cannot be embedded in transactions.
The ideas of this library are described in
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/PADL08.html">this paper</a>.
